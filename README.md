+ According to the results of the linear regression model, we can deduce that ground clearance, vehicle length, and intercept have a significant correlation with 
MPG. The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero because our r squared value is rather high and none of the slopes equal zero. Therefore, because of the p and r squared values, we can consider this model to be an effective measurement of MPG.
